Current functions
-----------------

* Plot(projected) band structure
* Plot density of states 
* Setup and plot 2D band structure
* Setup and plot spin texture
* Plot the in-plane average of electrostatic potential for work function calculation
* Spacegroup analysis, unit cell transformation, and exporting POSCAR, xsf, or cif (with or without symmetry)
