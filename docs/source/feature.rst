Features
========


Current functions
-----------------

* Basic electronic structure analysis: (projected) band structure, density of states 
* 2D analysis: 2D band structure, spin texture
* In-plane average of electrostatic potential for work function calculation
* Structure analysis: spacegroup analysis, unit cell transformation, working with cif file, and variety of structure formats (POSCAR, cif, xsf)
* Read WAVECAR and visualize the (real/imaginary) periodic part of a Bloch state
* Read WAVEDER/WAVEDERF to get the derivative of the orbitals with respect to k
* Currently, only VASP outpus are supported (vasprun.xml, OUTCAR)


Soon-to-be-released functions
-----------------------------
* Connecting to Bilbao Crystallographic Server
* Topological analysis
* Optical adsorption coefficient
 

Future functions
----------------
* Phonon calculation
* Band structure unfolding
* Set up a EOS calculation
