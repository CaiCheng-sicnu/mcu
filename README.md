# Modeling and Crystallographic Utilities (mcu)
- A package for post periodic wave function and crystallography analysis.
- Currently mcu onlys support VASP outputs but other electronic codes are under development and will be released soon.

# Future functions:
 - Topological analysis
 - Optical adsorption coefficient
 - Set up a EOS calculation
 - Phonon calculation
 - Spin texture
 - Orbital-projected band structure
 - Band structure unfolding
