# Modeling and Crystallographic Utilities (mcu)
- A package for post periodic wave function and crystallography analysis.
- Currently **mcu** only supports VASP outputs but other electronic codes are under development and will be released soon.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.5 or higher
- Numby 1.8.0 or higher

# Current functions:
- A class to extract all the info from vasprun.xml 
- Plotting band structure
- Computing bandgap


# Future functions:
 - Projected band structure
 - Topological analysis
 - Optical adsorption coefficient
 - Set up a EOS calculation
 - Phonon calculation
 - Spin texture
 - Band structure unfolding
